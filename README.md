# Tinder-Auto-Swap
I automated the proccess of swapping on python. But it decides to like or dislike randomly. I put a delay between each swipe to avoid bans, but use it on your own risk.

To run the code, follow the steps below:

Run pip install requirements.txt.<br/>
Download chromedriver according to your chrome version.<br/>
Update the passwords.py with your facebook username and password.<br/>
Run py bot_tinder.py on your terminal.<br/>

Enjoy!

This project was just to study and have some fun coding.
